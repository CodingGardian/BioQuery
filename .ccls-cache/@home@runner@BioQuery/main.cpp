// TODO: need memeory managment
//  #1 try to allocate and deallocate large blocks of memory at a time
//  #2 linked list for memory blocks???
//  #3 revisit STL library, what might I need to reimplement?

// linked list with shared pointer functionality
//   code should be able to tell if a list has been deleted and respond accordingly
//   Memory managment too :(
